<h1>welcome to the coven</h1>

<center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ojQb9Ww.png"></center><br>

<p>You walk into the desolate cemetery full of dreaded trees while the bright blue moon light shines upon a pale skinned figure in the distance. They are surrounded by the graves of the dammed who once walked upon this earth with their sinful deads, no impure soul shall walk thy soil, says the sign at the very gates. You can see their clutched hands at the height of their chest, their delicately sculpted face, almost the form of an renaissance painting, with thin lips that seems to move in prayer and mercy they turn their face towards you, the sharp teeth and the stark white eyes say all you need to know, if you don't run now, you won't have another chance to do so.</p>
<p>Their clothes were as dark as the night itself, and as an unfortunate cloud covered the sacred light of the moon you see their eyes glow in the darkness. As you blink, they disappear from you vision, you've run into an angel of death from beyond the grave, you may now pay the consequences, dearest mortal, you are vital for my survival, and the continuation of my beautiful masquerade<sup><a href="#masquerade">?</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The beautiful angels inside of my head have already decided thy fate, my dearest, the circle of life is cruel and dreadful, just like my existence, but nothing gives me more joy than the hunt<sup><a href="#hunt">?</a></sup>. The barrens<sup><a href="#barrens">?</a></sup> are my sacred domain, and stepping your living veins on this soil decided the fate of your poor soul. The beast<sup><a href="#beast">?</a></sup> screams and claws at the walls of my being, the hunger<sup><a href="#hunger">?</a></sup> consumes all of us who are blessed with the Embrace<sup><a href="#embrace">?</a></sup>, Gehenna<sup><a href="#gehenna">?</a></sup> may be upon my Kindred<sup><a href="#kindred">?</a></sup>, but we are the childe<sup><a href="#childe">?</a></sup> of Caine<sup><a href="#caine">?</a></sup>, and I'll make sure we walk this cursed Earth until the very end of time itself.</p>
<p>The Sabbat<sup><a href="#sabbat">?</a></sup> is my home, and as a cainite<sup><a href="#cainite">?</a></sup> I have the eternity long duty of preserving my blood<sup><a href="#blood">?</a></sup>, just like my sire before me, and their sire<sup><a href="#sire">?</a></sup> before them, all the way back to Caine we have stalked the darkness and preyed upon the kine<sup><a href="#kine">?</a></sup> to survive, but that necessity is over. Out blood has started to run thin, and we need to purify our lineage once more.</p>
<p>Now your blood runs throughout their skinny and cold hands, the warm liquid flowing though their fingers like running water in a forest. Your decrepit body lies on the ground, you last vision is the moon, what a beautiful thing to see in your death bed, but the shape of the cursed church is still in your sight, to remember you for the next eternity the biggest sin you've ever committed: walk into the domain of Mercy Báthory, the priestess of the Sabbat, the savior of the dammed souls, the angel of death and salvation walking along this earth... I have now washed you from your sins and send you to the heavens as a clean creature.</p>

∟ Doctorate: You are well-versed in what hasn’t been written.<br><br>

<center><b>DISCIPLINES</b></center><br>
<b>Auspex:</b> ⦿⦿⦿⦿⦿ ⦿〇〇〇〇<br>
∟ Telepathic Communication: allows a character to pick up only the surface thoughts of other individuals, and to speak to one at a time. With Telepathic Communication, a character can form a more powerful link between his mind and that of other subjects, allowing them to converse in words, concepts, and sensory images at the speed of thought. Vampires with this level of Auspex can act as “switchboard operators,” creating a telepathic web that allows all participants to share thoughts with some or all other members of the network as they choose.<br>
<b>Celerity:</b> ⦿⦿⦿⦿⦿ ⦿〇〇〇〇<br>
∟ Despite the fact that a vampire with Celerity moves at incredible speeds, any bullets he fires or knives he throws while in this state don’t move any faster than they normally would. Scientifically minded Kindred have been baffled by the phenomenon for centuries, but more pragmatic ones have found a way to work around it. Projectile enables a vampire to take his preternatural speed and transfer it into something he has thrown, fired, or launched.<br>
<b>Dementation:</b> ⦿⦿⦿⦿⦿ ⦿⦿〇〇〇<br>
∟ The elder with this fearsome power has the ability to twist his victims’ psyches at their most basic levels, warping their very beings. The subject of Restructure retains her memories, but her outlook on life changes completely, as if she has undergone a sudden epiphany or religious conversion. This effect goes much deeper than the implantation of a derangement; it actually performs a complete rewrite of the victim’s personality.<br>
<b>Dominate:</b> ⦿⦿⦿⦿⦿ ⦿⦿〇〇〇<br>
∟ Despite its name, this power may be employed on vampires as well as mortals, and it has left more than one unfortunate victim writhing in agony — or unable to do even that. A vampire who has developed this power is able to override her victim’s body as easily as his mind in order to cut off his senses or even stop his heart. It is rumored that this power once came more easily to the Kindred, but modern medicine has made the bodies and spirits of mortals more resistant to such manipulations.<br>
<b>Thaumaturgy:</b> ⦿⦿⦿⦿〇 ⦿⦿⦿⦿〇<br>
<i>Path 1 - Hands of Destruction</i><br>
∟ Atrophy: This power withers a victim’s limb, leaving only a desiccated, almost mummified husk of bone and skin. The effects are instantaneous; in mortals, they are also irreversible.<br>
<i>Path 2 - Father's Vengeance</i><br>
∟ Uriel's Disfavor: This power invokes the darkness of the Angel of Death. All but the dimmest of light causes the subject excruciating pain, and some artificial forms of bright light may even damage the vampire. Uriel delivered God’s curse on Caine, shielding him in the blackness of his wings.<br>
<b>Vicissitude:</b> ⦿⦿⦿⦿⦿ ⦿〇〇〇〇<br>
∟ Chiropteran Marauder: Similar to Horrid Form, the Chiropteran Marauder is a terrifying, bipedal bat, bearing a wickedly fanged maw and veined, leathery wings. This power confers all of the benefits of the Horrid Form, in addition to a few others. The mere sight of the marauder is enough to make mortals or weak-willed vampires flee in horror.<br><br>

<center><b>RITUALS</b></center><br>
<b>Bind the Accusing Tongue:</b> This ancient ritual is said to have been one of the first developed by the Tremere and a primary reason for the lack of cohesive opposition to their expansion. Bind the Accusing Tongue lays a compulsion upon the subject that prevents him from speaking ill of the caster, allowing the thaumaturge to commit literally unspeakable acts without fear of reprisal.<br>
<b>Devil's Touch:</b> Thaumaturges use this ritual to place curses upon mortals who earn their ire. Using this ritual marks an individual invisibly, causing all those who come in contact with him to receive him poorly. The mortal is treated as the most loathsome individual conceivable, and all who deal with him do everything in their power to make him miserable. Even bums spit at an afflicted individual, and children taunt him and barrage him with vulgarities.
Recure of the Homeland: The vampire calls on the power of the earth to heal grave wounds she may have received. The thaumaturge must use at least a handful of dirt from the city or town of her mortal birth and recite a litany of her mortal family tree as she casts this ritual.<br>
<b>Incorporeal Passage:</b> Use of this ritual allows the thaumaturge to make herself insubstantial. The caster becomes completely immaterial and thus is able to walk through walls, pass through closed doors, escape manacles, etc. The caster also becomes invulnerable to physical attacks for the duration of the ritual. The caster must follow a straight path through any physical objects, and may not draw back. Thus, a Kindred may walk through a solid wall, but may not walk down through the earth (as it would be impossible to reach the other side before the ritual lapsed). This ritual requires that the caster carry a shard from a shattered mirror to hold her image.<br><br>

<b>Black Hand Membership:</b> ⦿⦿⦿〇〇<br>
∟ You are held in the Black Hand’s regard; you may call upon five Black.<br>

<b>Mentor:</b> ⦿⦿⦿⦿〇<br>
∟ Mentor has a great deal of power over the city: a Prince or Archbishop, for example.<br>
<b>Rituals:</b> ⦿⦿⦿⦿⦿<br>
∟ You know all the auctoritas ritae and dozens of ignoblis ritae. You may create your own ignoblis ritae, given enough time. You are also familiar with the functions of almost all regional and pack-specific ignoblis ritae, even if you cannot perform them; if it’s been written down or passed around in lore, you’ve heard of it.<br>

∟ Resolute.<br>
<b>Willpower:</b> ⦿⦿⦿⦿⦿ 〇〇〇〇〇<br>
∟ Certain.<br><br>

<center><b>MERITS & FLAWS</b></center><br>
<b>Natural Leader:</b> You are gifted with a certain magnetism to which others naturally defer.<br>
<b>Catlike Balance:</b> You possess an innately perfect sense of balance.<br>
<b>Sanctity:</b> This Merit is sometimes called the halo effect; everyone considers you pure and innocent, though not necessarily naïve. You have a saint-like quality that is hard to pinpoint but cannot be denied. You are trusted, even if you are not trustworthy.<br>
<b>Oracular Ability:</b> You can see and interpret signs and omens. You are able to draw advice from these omens, for they provide hints of the future and warnings of the present.<br>
<b>Enchanting Voice:</b> There is something about your voice that others cannot ignore. When you command, they are cowed. When you seduce, they swoon. Whether thundering, soothing, persuading, or simply talking, your voice commands attention.<br><br>

<b>Glowing Eyes:</b> You have the stereotypical glowing eyes of vampire legend.<br>
<b>Permanent Fangs:</b> Your fangs do not retract, making it impossible for you to hide your true nature. While some mortals may think you’ve had your teeth filed or are wearing prosthetics, sooner or later you’re going to run into someone who knows what you truly are.<br>
<b>Thirst for Innocence:</b> The sight of innocence — of any sort — arouses in you a terrible bloodlust.<br>
<b>Hunted:</b> You are pursued by a fanatical witch-hunter who believes (perhaps correctly) that you are a danger to humanity. All those with whom you associate, be they mortal or Kindred, may be hunted as well.<br>
<b>Deathsight:</b> Everything appears rotted and decayed to you. The world appears to you as a corpse; mortals look diseased or skeletal, buildings seem decrepit, and your fellow Kindred seem to be walking, moldering cadavers.<br>
<b>Grip of the Damned:</b> There is no ecstasy in your Embrace — only terror and pain. Mortals upon whom you feed struggle and shriek while you attempt to feed, requiring you to grapple with them for as long as you wish to take their blood.<br><br>

<center><b>HUMANITY / PATH</b></center><br>
<b>Humanity:</b> ⦿⦿⦿⦿⦿ 〇〇〇〇〇<br>
∟ Distant. People die. Stuff breaks. A vampire below the cultural human norm has little difficulty with the fact that she needs blood to survive, and she does what needs to be done to get it. Though she won’t necessarily go out of her way to destroy property or end a victim’s life, she accepts that sometimes that’s what fate has in store for some folks. Though not constantly horrid, Kindred at this stage of Humanity are certainly at least mildly unpleasant to be around. Their laissez-faire attitudes toward others’ rights offend many more moral individuals.<br><br>

<b>The Path of Caine</b><br>
∟ Sons and Daughters of Caine should always seek information regarding the vampiric condition, through experience, personal growth, and the pursuit of occult lore. Diablerie, development of Disciplines, and self-mastery are all valid means of refining the vampiric form. Noddists rarely engage in politics, choosing instead to acquire new information and experiences.
They also serve as priests who lead vampires to seek awareness — and development — of their undead condition. Those on this Path lead by example, embracing their monstrous natures and striving to attune themselves to their differences from humans, then helping other vampires do the same. Noddists do not hesitate to share their insights, so that all vampires have the opportunity to become closer to Caine, though they hoard dangerous secrets to prevent misuse.<br><br>

<center><b>WEAKNESS</b></center><br>
All members of Clan Malkavian suffer from a permanent, incurable derangement. They may acquire and recover from other derangements, and may spend Willpower to ameliorate the effects of the derangement for a scene, but they can never recover from their original derangement.<br><br>

Vampires acquire their sustenance in many fashions. Some cultivate “herds” of willing mortals, who cherish the ecstasy of the vampire’s Kiss. Some creep into houses by night, feeding from sleeping humans. Some stalk the mortals’ playgrounds — the nightclubs, bars, and theaters — enticing mortals into illicit liaisons and disguising their predation as acts of passion. And
yet others take their nourishment in the most ancient fashion — stalking, attacking, and incapacitating (or
even killing) mortals who wander too far into lonely nocturnal alleys and empty lots.<br><br>
