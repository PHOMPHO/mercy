<h1>welcome to the coven</h1>

<p>You walk into the desolate cemetery full of dreaded trees while the bright blue moon light shines upon a pale skinned figure in the distance. They are surrounded by the graves of the dammed who once walked upon this earth with their sinful deads, no impure soul shall walk thy soil, says the sign at the very gates. You can see their clutched hands at the height of their chest, their delicately sculpted face, almost the form of an renaissance painting, with thin lips that seems to move in prayer and mercy they turn their face towards you, the sharp teeth and the stark white eyes say all you need to know, if you don't run now, you won't have another chance to do so.</p>
<p>Their clothes where as dark as the night itself, and as an unfortunate cloud covered the sacred light of the moon you see their eyes glow in the darkness. As you blink, they disappear from you vision, you've run into an angel of death from beyond the grave, you may now pay the consequences, dearest mortal, you are vital for my survival, and the continuation of my beautiful masquerade.</p>
<p>The beautiful angels inside of my head have already decided thy fate, my dearest, the circle of life is cruel and dreadful, just like my existence, but nothing gives me more joy than the hunt. The barrens are my sacred domain, and stepping your living veins on this soil decided the fate of your poor soul. The beast screams and claws at the walls of my being, the hunger consumes all of us who are blessed with the Embrace, Gehenna may be upon my Kindred, but we are the childe of Caine, and I'll make sure we walk this cursed Earth until the very end of time itself.</p>
<p>The Sabbat is my home, and as a cainite I have the eternity long duty of preserving my blood, just like my sire before me, and their sire before them, all the way back to Caine we have stalked the darkness and preyed upon the kine to survive, but that necessity is over. Out blood has started to run thin, and we need to purify our lineage once more.</p>
<p>Now your blood runs throughout their skinny and cold hands, the warm liquid flowing though their fingers like running water in a forest. Your decrepit body lies on the ground, you last vision is the moon, what a beautiful thing to see in your death bed, but the shape of the cursed church is still in your sight, to remember you for the next eternity the biggest sin you've ever committed: walk into the domain of Mercy Bathory, the priestess of the Sabbat, the savior of the dammed souls, the angel of death and salvation walking along this earth... I have now washed you from your sins and send you to the heavens as a clean creature.</p>

<p>The writing in blood decorates the wall of the palace, also known as the church of the dammed, the domain of the undead angel known as Mercy of the house of BÃ¡thory. Born in the 12th day of July in 1604 I've lived my lives, maybe as many as I've taken from this world, who know anymore, the eternities are infinite, and so is the hunter of the beast.</p>

<i>Opabinia</i> made it clear how little was known about soft-bodied animals, which do not usually leave fossils. When Whittington described it in the mid-1970s, there was already a vigorous debate about the early evolution of animals. Preston Cloud argued in 1948 and 1968 that the process was "explosive", and in the early 1970s Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould developed their theory of punctuated equilibrium, which views evolution as long intervals of near-stasis "punctuated" by short periods of rapid change. On the other hand, around the same time Wyatt Durham and Martin Glaessner both argued that the animal kingdom had a long Proterozoic history that was hidden by the lack of fossils. Whittington (1975) concluded that <i>Opabinia</i>, and other taxa such as <i>Marrella</i> and <i>Yohoia</i>, cannot be accommodated in modern groups. This was one of the primary reasons why Gould in his book on the Burgess Shale, <i>Wonderful Life</i>, considered that Early Cambrian life was much more diverse and "experimental" than any later set of animals and that the Cambrian explosion was a truly dramatic event, possibly driven by unusual evolutionary mechanisms. He regarded <i>Opabinia</i> as so important to understanding this phenomenon that he wanted to call his book <i>Homage to Opabinia</i>.<br><br>

However, other discoveries and evaluations soon followed, revealing similar-looking animals such as <i>Anomalocaris</i> from the Burgess Shale and <i>Kerygmachela</i> from Sirius Passet. Another Burgess Shale animal, <i>Aysheaia</i>, was considered very similar to modern <i>Onychophora</i>, which are regarded as close relatives of arthropods. Paleontologists defined a group called lobopods to include animals that are thought to be close relatives of arthropods but lack jointed limbs. There is still debate about whether lobopods are monophyletic, i.e. whether they include all and only the descendants of a single common ancestor, and about whether arthropods are a sub-group of lobopods or a sister-group.</div>
